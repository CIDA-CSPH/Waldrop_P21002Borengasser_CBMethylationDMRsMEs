This repository documents the code used to analyze the data for "Cord Blood DNA Methylation of Differentially Methylated Regions Associates with Infant and Child adiposity‚Äù

Code used for analysis are detailed under analysisCode/

This code is generalized here, but was run for each of the outcomes of interest (changes in adiposity across the 3 timepoints, pairwise)

Analysis proceeded in the following order:
* ewas_code.R (includes function defined in ewas_fun.R)
* combp_setup.R
* combp_analyses.sh
* clean_combp.R (includes function defined in methyl_dir_fun.R)

Session information for these analyses are detailed in analysis_sessionInfo.md


Methylation data was batch corrected using combat prior to analysis. We show the adequacy of this correction with MDS plots of probes by plate before and after correction in QC_combatCorrections/
